## 👾 About me

My professional journey in technology has taken me across various borders and cultures, enriching my expertise and perspective as a developer. 

At the core of my technical portfolio is a profound mastery of React Native and JavaScript, complemented by substantial experience with React, NextJS, NodeJS, MongoDB Docker and Google Cloud Platform, helping me gain greater context and knowledge over the entire application architecture.

I'm pround to have contributed to leading tech companies as Google in the [Google partner marketing hub](https://partnermarketinghub.withgoogle.com/) project, where I have learned a ton and not only helped me to improve my skills in developing scalable and efficient applications, but also deepened my understanding of global software practices and collaboration in diverse environments and cultures.

As the founder of **Grabitt.co**, I’ve turned ideas into reality, enhancing user engagement through innovative software solutions. My entrepreneurial spirit drives me to continually seek out new challenges and create applications that not only meet but exceed user expectations.

Beyond coding, I love to explore the world through my lens as a [**photographer**](https://www.instagram.com/diegoguevara) 📸 and express my creativity as a **House music deejay** 🎧.
