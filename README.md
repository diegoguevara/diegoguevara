# 👋 Hey, I’m Diego

Founder & Senior Software Engineer based in Bogotá, Colombia 🇨🇴  

I build cross-platform products using **React Native, Web, and NodeJS**, focusing on clean architecture, scalability, and real business impact.

I’m the founder of [Grabitt.co](https://www.grabitt.co), a SaaS platform for employee engagement and organizational climate analytics.  
I also created [HamSpark](https://qsl.hamspark.com), a digital QSL generator and community-focused project for amateur radio operators.

I’ve contributed to large-scale international initiatives (including work within [Google’s Partner Marketing Hub](https://partnermarketinghub.withgoogle.com/) ecosystem), collaborating with distributed teams across cultures and time zones.

## 🚀 Products & Experiments

I enjoy designing, building and shipping systems end-to-end from idea and architecture to deployment and long-term evolution and focused products — some as SaaS platforms, others as lightweight tools published to real users.
